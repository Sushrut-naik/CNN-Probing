# CNN-Probing

Probing a CNN to see what its intermediate layers are learning.

## Description

This repository contains experiments and code to probe Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to understand what their intermediate layers are learning. The main goal is to analyze the features extracted at each layer of the network and visualize them.

## Repository Structure

The repository is composed entirely of Jupyter Notebook files. These notebooks contain the code and results of various experiments conducted to probe the CNN.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need the following software:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relevant Python libraries (listed in each notebook)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sushrut-naik/CNN-Probing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd CNN-Probing
   ```
### Running the Notebooks
Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the repository directory. You can then open and run the notebooks to see the experiments and results.
